# crispy-pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that works as follows: work for 25 minutes, then rest for 5 minutes.
Then repeat that cycle four times. After the fourth cycle take a longer break e.g. 15-20 minutes.

# Azure DevOps
This project is also for me to practise DevOps and chose Azure DevOps as a way to do that.

The goal is to implement a CI&CD pipeline that includes running tests, packing and deploying the web app 
continuously.
